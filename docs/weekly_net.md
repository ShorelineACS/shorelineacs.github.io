We have an on-the-air meeting – a net – each Monday evening on the Primary Shoreline repeater on 442.825 (+5 MHz, PL 103.5) at 1930 local time for the purpose of training, conducting team business and testing personal equipment. 

This net is typically an information type net and conducted in a formal manner. That means all check-ins, traffic and information is coordinated through the Net Control Station. There are times when you may have the opportunity to be Net Control. 

Although, as with most nets, we have a standard format and preamble to follow, these are not needed in order to conduct a successful session. Being Net Control is just that – you are in control of the net. Run the net in whatever way makes you comfortable. As long as you get all the stations checked in and handle any required announcements or requests for information, it is a successful net. It is important that all members have an opportunity to be Net Control for the Monday night net; it is good training for controlling a net during an emergency.
